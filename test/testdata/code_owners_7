# The `docs/*` pattern will match files like

# A leading "**" followed by a slash means match in all directories. 
# For example, "**/foo" matches file or directory "foo" anywhere, 
# the same as pattern "foo". "**/foo/bar" matches file or directory "bar" 
# anywhere that is directly under directory "foo".
**/test @my_org/test_team

# A trailing "/**" matches everything inside. For example, "abc/**" 
# matches all files inside directory "abc", relative to the location of 
# the .gitignore file, with infinite depth.
other/** @my_org/other_team

# A slash followed by two consecutive asterisks then a slash matches 
# zero or more directories. For example, "a/**/b" matches "a/b", "a/x/b", 
# "a/x/y/b" and so on.
